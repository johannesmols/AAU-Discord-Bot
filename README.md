This bot is made for the unofficial Aalborg University discord server.

## Documentation

#### Verification

In the `#verify-me` channel on discord you can write `!verify`. The bot will respond to that command with a randomly generated passphrase and a sign on link. In order to verify that you are a student at Aalborg University you need to sign in with the same username and password you combination you would otherwise use at AAU.
_#TODO: Implement the next part._
After signing in you need to enter the passphrase in the text box and click verify.

#### Study programmes

Once verified, a user can use the `#assign-me` channel to assign themselves to their study programme using the `!assign [study programme]` command.
